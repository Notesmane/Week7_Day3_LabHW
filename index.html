                <p>A Single Page Application (SPA) is a website or web application that dynamically rewrites an existing web page with new information from the web server. In a React application, components retrieve site content and render it to a single HTML file in your project.</p>

                <p>The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.   React’s primary role in an application is to handle the view layer of that application just like the V in a model-view-controller (MVC) pattern by providing the best and most efficient rendering execution. Rather than dealing with the whole user interface as a single unit, React.js encourages developers to separate these complex UIs into individual reusable components that form the building blocks of the whole UI. In doing so, the ReactJS framework combines the speed and efficiency of JavaScript with a more efficient method of manipulating the DOM to render web pages faster and create highly dynamic and responsive web applications.</p>

                <p>JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension and occasionally referred as JavaScript XML) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers commonly used in React. It is similar in appearance to HTML. React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be as components may also be written in pure JavaScript. JSX is created by Meta (formerly Facebook). It is similar to another extension syntax created by Meta for PHP called XHP. Apart from React, JSX was adopted by other frontend frameworks such as SolidJS.</p>

                <p>Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones). It makes available all the syntactical sugar that was added to JavaScript with the new ES6 specification, including classes, fat arrows and multiline strings. We can also optionally use it to transpile TypeScript into regular JavaScript that will run in a browser.</p>

            <li>
                <p>At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static assets to serve your content from.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create React app is a command you run in the terminal. Create React app is the best way to quickly build a new React single-page application. What Create React app does is that it sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a good developer experience, and optimizes your app for production.</p>
